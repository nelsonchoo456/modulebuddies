## Project Overview

### Motivation
Due to the Covid-19 situation, the majority of lessons and tutorials have been shifted online. We have been so used to being behind our screens during lessons, and there is little opportunity for interaction and making friends.

Now that NUS is slowly transitioning back to physical lessons, it may be daunting for some as it may be their first time attending a physical lesson in such a long time. It would definitely be more comforting to attend these lessons with a friend. However, after being so used to having remote lessons, it may be difficult to take the first step to make friends with the person beside you. If only there was a way to get to know people who are taking the same module beforehand, hence making the process more enjoyable and fun with people you know.

Even after transitioning to physical lessons, some students may be too shy to approach to make new friends to study with or share problems they may face pertaining modules they are enrolled in. A forum page for different modules will allow students to connect with one another and help each other out so that they can improve together. Moreover, they can create study groups for them to share content privately within the group.

### Vision
**You are not alone in your educational journey***
We envision a better learning environment for NUS students where they do not feel left out from not having university friends due to the online mode of learning at the start of their learning journey in NUS.
